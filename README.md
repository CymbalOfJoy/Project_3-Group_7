European Tourist Travel Project 3

Purpose
The goal of this project was to develop a web application that allows users to explore travel trends across Europe. We gathered data from a dataset on Kaggle that details how, when, and why travelers visited various cities in Europe. The application is designed to inspire users and help them plan their European vacations based on real travel data.

About the Dataset
Our dataset provides valuable insights into how people travel across Europe. It includes data on:
Mode of Travel: Flight, Car, Bicycle, Bus, and Train.
Accommodation Types: Hotels, Airbnb's, and Camping.
Purpose of Travel: Leisure, Business, and Family.
Additionally, it allows us to understand travel preferences such as what modes of transportation are most common, which countries are visited the most, and the primary reasons people travel.

Data Cleaning
To make the dataset useful for our web application, we needed to clean the data and add missing information. Specifically, the dataset did not include longitude and latitude, which we needed to create a map for the app. We added the necessary geographical data and saved the cleaned dataset into a new CSV file, from which we created an SQLite database for easy access.

Research Questions
1. What reason for travel had the most money spent on it?
Family visits: $925,024,000
Business: $863,977,000
Leisure: $811,377,000
2. What mode of travel is the most common?
Flight: The most common mode of transportation.
Bicycles: Surprisingly popular in Europe, likely due to the design of many European cities.
Cars: Less common due to narrower roads in many parts of Europe.
3. What countries received the most visitors?
Greece and Portugal: 11.2% of the dataset, tied for the most visits.
Germany: 11.0%
Austria and Switzerland: Just above 10%
Other countries: France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and the UK, all with less than 10%. The UK received the least visits at 8.4%.

Data Limitations and Bias
We encountered a limitation when the dataset we used was removed from Kaggle after our download. This made it difficult to reference other work related to our data. Additionally, the dataset itself was limited in scopeâ€”containing only a general overview of travel trends in Europe, rather than offering in-depth details on travelers' decisions.

Conclusions
Most Common Travel Method: Flights were the most popular method of transportation to Europe.
Top Destinations: Greece and Portugal received the most visitors, while the UK was the least visited.
Most Common Reason for Travel: Family visits accounted for the highest amount of spending.
Unexpected Trends: Business travel exceeded leisure travel in popularity, and bicycles were used more than cars in many European cities.

Call to Action
Transportation: While flying is the most common mode of travel, consider alternatives like trains or bicycles, especially when traveling within cities that are more bike-friendly.
Off-the-Beaten-Path: Travelers seeking less crowded destinations may want to consider countries like the UK or the Netherlands, which had lower visitation rates.

Future Work
Data Expansion: The dataset's 1,000 entries are limited. Expanding the data to include more diverse demographics and travel behaviors would provide more detailed insights into trends, visit types, and transportation choices.
More Granular Trends: With a larger dataset, we could explore more specific travel trends across different countries, seasons, and visitor demographics.
